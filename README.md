### ✨ Overview <br>
AniMAGIC is a modern web app built with Streamlit and powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 and Manim. Describe your animation idea in natural language, and AniMAGIC will interpret your intent, generate Python code using Manim, render the animation, and display the output — all within seconds.

✅ Prompt: “A red triangle rotates and morphs into a blue circle.”

🎬 Output: Professionally rendered Manim scene visualized instantly.

Note: Not for production use. This is more of an MVP. The manim code auto-generated by GPT4 sometimes breaks & needs to be manually fixed.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toashishagarwal/animagic.git
   cd animagic
   ```
   
2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Make sure you also install:
- ffmpeg (for video encoding)
- LaTeX (recommended but not required, we use text rendering fallback)

4. Configure API Key
Store your key in Streamlit secrets or use OS environment variable: <br>

Option 1: Streamlit Secrets (recommended for Streamlit Sharing)

```bash
Create a file called .streamlit/secrets.toml:

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

Option 2: Set it as an environment variable
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Running the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your browser

### How It Works
- User enters a natural language description (e.g. “A circle turns into a square”).
- AniMAGIC uses GPT-4 to generate minimal, clean Python code compatible with Manim.
- The code is executed using subprocess and saved as an .mp4 video.
- The generated code and animation preview are displayed in the browser.
- No LaTeX required — all text uses Text() instead of Tex/MathTex
